# Journo Viewer

The Journo Viewer is a javafx application simplifying the workflow of creating Freemarker Templates that
are rendered into a PDF using Journo. It requires a JDK version 17 or higher with JavaFx included (such as the [Bellsoft full distribution](https://bell-sw.com/pages/downloads/#jdk-17-lts))
for both compilation and running.

You start the application with e.g. `java -jar journo-viewer-0.6.0.jar`.
